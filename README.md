# Certificates Earned in RF Engineering, Robotics, and Computer Vision
<p align="justify">
This repository showcases a selection of my certificates in RF Engineering, Robotics, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning, along with fundamental courses in Mathematics, Science, and Programming.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Note that these certificates build upon two things: my eternal love for and pursuit of knowledge, and my training as an electrical engineer at the university level. I have been either self-taught—which essentially means using Google, books (PDF), and YouTube—or have credited various courses in the sciences, maths, and engineering. Thus, no direct need for acquiring external certificates in them was deemed useful. For example, I don't have external certificates to show that I am well aware of the fact that objects with a net force applied to them accelerate in the direction of that force, but one certainly knows that. Although what was just said is correct in the general sense, it isn't that accurate if one deeply thinks about it. It isn't the university's job to graduate ready to engineer engineers, and most importantly, well aware of the universe's rules and how to exploit them, humans, so one will continue learning what one bets is interesting, useful, entertaining, and work relevant, in that order of importance.
